# FDM Expenses Appp

This example project shows an expense application that I made using Google's firebase api.
The website works by letting signed-in users submit expenses which can then be either approved or rejected by a line manager.
The app also provides information about an employee's own pending, accepted and reject applications and allows images to be attached and stored alongside submitted expenses.

Below please find some of the account details to review or test out the application.
